                For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to innovate, we learned to think and we came to this age of innovation. Still we have a lot to go and still we have lot to innovate. For innovation to take place, a platform is needed. Kathmandu University Robotics Club provides with the platform and technical support to young enthusiastic innovators to unleash their capability.
